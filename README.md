# CPT283_Assignment1
Assignment 1 for my CPT 283 PHP class (heat index calculator)

Reflection assignment: Describe, in detail, what was learned from completing this specific Program

I learned quite a bit from completing this program!

First, I learned how to print a constant to the page, and concatenate it with HTML tags in order to format it. This was a challenge as I first thought it was an issue of using the wrong type of quotation marks (single vs double), but as I went back and reviewed constants, I found that they cannot be placed in quotation marks at all, or it will be printed literally. 

Second, I learned that I can use any HTML tags inside the PHP tags, and format it with attributes and CSS just as I would with normal HTML. This was really awesome to learn as it means I can practice with my HTML and CSS skills while learning PHP.

I also did some debugging of my program, which is not something I’ve had to do much of with HTML and CSS. I got some errors at different stages while testing my program, and the solutions were to make sure to include semicolons at the end of every statement within the PHP tags, and to make sure the server was running and my files were in the correct location.

Finally, while I had a concept of planning code before writing it, much of the work I’ve done up until this point has been in CSS and HTML, which don’t necessarily require the same step by step planning. So this assignment helped to emphasize the importance of planning/writing pseudo-code.
